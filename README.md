The code that handles chat triggers, point redeems, audio, visual effects, and more for [CareFreeBomb's Twitch stream](https://www.twitcht.tv/carefreebomb). It is used as a browser source inside of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) with the remote debug console docked. The source is posted here not with the intent to be run locally, but for the purposes of backup and example for any curious parties.
